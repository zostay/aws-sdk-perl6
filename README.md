# AWS SDK for Perl 6

As of this writing, this is incomplete. However, once complete, this will be
experimental and anything might change. I'm hoping to start using it in some
projects, though, so as soon as that happens, it probably won't change very
much.

Some of what I am doing here is modeled after the excellent Paws project for
Perl. However, this is not aimed at being a port of their work.
